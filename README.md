 Connecting nintendo switch controllers to a computer


 Big helps:
 https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering,
 
 and the Node.js `switch-joy-con` package. Was originally going to use this in order to do this project, but it didn't work (:/) so I had to make my own version of it for it to work.
 
 
 
 
 if someone sees this and knows an example list of bytes for the controller to rumble/vibrate pls open an issue and tell me this is the one thing that i **cannot** figure out ;-;  


oh yea to run it yourself download it and run `npm install` in the repository then `node app.js` to run it  
idk if this is the up to date one, so it might not work
